BlueTune Media Framework 
------------------------

BlueTune is a framework for digital media playback.
It brings together, under a common framework, a core engine and a number
of plugins to read input media, decode it, and send the decoded samples
to an output.

You can find out more about the license in LICENSE.txt, about how to 
build the framework and sample code in BUILD.txt, and about the example
applications and sample code in EXAMPLES.txt
For information about the optional WMA plugin, refer to WMA.txt
You can also read some of the API documentation produced from the source
code comments using Doxygen. The doxygen output is available as a 
windows CHM file in BlueTune.chm, and a set of HTML pages zipped together
in BlueTune-HTML.zip (to start, open the file named index.html with an 
HTML browser)
